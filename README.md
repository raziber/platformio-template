# Hybrid Hardware/Software Project Template

This template provides a clean, scalable structure for projects that include:

- Hardware modules (PlatformIO)
- Python tools/scripts
- Apps (desktop/mobile)
- Documentation
- Automation/scripts

## Notes

- Each hardware module should have its own PlatformIO project.
- Open `project.code-workspace` in VSCode.
